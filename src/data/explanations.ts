        title: `Social democracy might be suitable for you.`,
        description: `Based on your answers, you seem to prefer reform and regulation over revolution or support a mixed market economy with a strong welfare state that provides universal access to essential services, progressive taxation, workers' rights, and regulations on businesses to create a more just and equitable society.`

        id: 3,
        title: `You subscribe to Marxism.`,
        description: `You seem to be mostly in agreement with Marx and Engels' theories and analyses of the development of human society, based on the idea that the economic structures of society are the primary factor that shapes the development of human history, while seeing class struggle as the engine of historical change. Marxism also argues that capitalism's inherent contradictions will lead to its eventual replacement by socialism.`

        id: 5,
        title: `You have many similarities to a socialist.`,

        id: 6,
        title: `You're not just left-wing but also nationalist.`,
        description: `While you seem to advocate for social and economic justice to mitigate the inequalities created by global capitalism, you also put an emphasis on national identity.
