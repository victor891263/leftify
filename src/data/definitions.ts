        title: 'Anti-authoritarianism',
        body: `Anti-authoritarianism is a political philosophy or perspective that opposes authoritarianism, which is a form of government or social organization characterized by strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom and autonomy. Anti-authoritarians believe that individuals and communities should have as much autonomy as possible, and that power should be distributed as widely as possible, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few people or institutions.

Anti-authoritarians reject the idea that authority is inherently legitimate or necessary, and instead prioritize individual freedom, voluntary association, and direct democracy. They also tend to be skeptical of traditional forms of authority, such as the state, the police, and organized religion, and may seek to create alternative forms of social organization and decision-making, such as horizontal or consensus-based structures.
        
Anti-authoritarianism has been associated with various political movements throughout history, including anarchism, libertarian socialism, and certain forms of feminism, environmentalism, and anti-globalization activism.`

        title: 'Anti-capitalism',
        body: `Anti-capitalism is a political and economic ideology or movement that opposes the capitalist system, which is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, the creation of goods and services for profit, and the accumulation of wealth and power by a small group of owners or investors. Anti-capitalists argue that capitalism is inherently unjust, exploitative, and unsustainable, and that it leads to increasing inequality, poverty, and environmental destruction.

Anti-capitalists advocate for alternative forms of economic organization, such as socialism, communism, anarchism, or participatory economics, which prioritize collective ownership and control of the means of production, and the production of goods and services for the benefit of society as a whole, rather than for the profit of a few. They also emphasize the importance of democracy, equality, and social justice, and argue that these values cannot be fully realized within a capitalist system.
        
Anti-capitalism is often associated with social and environmental movements, such as labor unions, anti-globalization protests, and climate justice activism. Some anti-capitalists may also advocate for reforms within the capitalist system, such as increased regulation, progressive taxation, or a guaranteed basic income, as a way to mitigate its worst effects.`

        title: 'Authority',
        body: `Authority refers to the power or right to give commands, make decisions, and enforce obedience. It is the ability to influence the behavior and actions of others, often through the use of force, coercion, or persuasion.

Authority can take many forms, including legal authority (based on laws and regulations), moral authority (based on principles of right and wrong), and charismatic authority (based on personal qualities such as charm, charisma, or expertise).
        
In social and political contexts, authority is often associated with institutions such as governments, religious organizations, and educational institutions, as well as with individuals who hold positions of power or influence. The concept of authority is closely related to that of power, as both involve the ability to control or influence the behavior of others.
        
However, authority is often seen as more legitimate or justified than mere power, as it is based on some form of recognized expertise, social status, or institutional structure. The exercise of authority is often subject to scrutiny and evaluation, and may be challenged or resisted by those who question its legitimacy or the actions taken in its name.`

    {
        title: 'Bottom-up structure',
        body: `A bottom-up organization or structure is one in which decision-making and control are decentralized and distributed among many individuals or groups, rather than being centralized in a few individuals or a single authority.

In a bottom-up organization, power and influence flow from the grassroots level upward, with individual members or local groups having a significant degree of autonomy and influence over decision-making processes. This approach emphasizes the importance of participation, collaboration, and open communication among members, and seeks to avoid the pitfalls of hierarchy and bureaucracy.
        
Examples of bottom-up organizations include worker cooperatives, where decision-making is made democratically by all members rather than by a top-down management structure, and grassroots social movements, where decisions are made by those directly affected by the issues and goals of the movement, rather than by a centralized leadership.
        
A bottom-up approach to organizing can promote greater accountability, transparency, and inclusivity, as well as fostering a sense of ownership and investment among participants. However, it can also be challenging to coordinate and scale up, and may be vulnerable to external pressures and competition.`

        title: 'Bourgeoisie',
        body: `The bourgeoisie is a term that originated in the 18th century and refers to the middle class, particularly those who are wealthy and influential in society. It is a social class that emerged during the rise of capitalism and industrialization, and it is often associated with the ownership of capital, property, and means of production.

The bourgeoisie played a significant role in the development of modern societies, particularly in the Western world, as they were instrumental in promoting economic growth, social mobility, and political reform. However, they have also been criticized for their exploitation of the working class and their pursuit of wealth and power at the expense of others.
        
The term "bourgeoisie" is often used in Marxist theory, which sees the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (working class) as the driving force behind historical change and social development. According to Marxist theory, the bourgeoisie uses its economic power to dominate society and exploit the working class, leading to alienation, inequality, and social conflict.`

    {
        title: 'Capitalism',
        body: `Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services, as well as the pursuit of profit as the main driver of economic activity. In a capitalist system, the market regulates the allocation of resources and determines the prices of goods and services.

Capitalism emerged in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, as a result of the growth of commerce, trade, and industrialization. It has since become the dominant economic system in much of the world, particularly in Western countries and their spheres of influence.
        
Proponents of capitalism argue that it promotes economic growth, innovation, and efficiency, and creates opportunities for individual achievement and prosperity. They point to the wealth and technological progress that has been generated by capitalist societies, as well as the freedom and autonomy that individuals enjoy under this system.
        
Critics of capitalism, however, argue that it leads to inequality, exploitation, and environmental degradation. They argue that the pursuit of profit often comes at the expense of workers, consumers, and the environment, and that it perpetuates social and economic inequalities by favoring the interests of the wealthy and powerful.`

    {
        title: 'Class',
        body: `A class is a group of people who share a common relationship to the means of production. This relationship is based on their position in the social and economic hierarchy, and determines their access to wealth, power, and social status.

There are two primary classes in capitalist societies: the bourgeoisie, who own and control the means of production, and the proletariat, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor in exchange for wages.
        
Class is a fundamental driver of social and economic relations, shaping the distribution of wealth and power within a society, as well as the organization of production and labor. Class conflict is seen as a central dynamic of capitalist societies, as the interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are fundamentally opposed.
        
Other classes also exist within capitalist societies, such as the petite bourgeoisie (small business owners and professionals), and the lumpenproletariat (those who are excluded from both the bourgeoisie and proletariat). However, these groups are generally seen as occupying subordinate positions in the class hierarchy, and their interests are often aligned with one of the primary classes.`

    {
        title: 'Common property',
        body: `Common property refers to resources or assets that are collectively owned and managed by a group of individuals or a community, rather than being privately owned or controlled by a single entity.

Examples of common property include shared land or water resources, public parks and forests, and cultural heritage sites. In a common property system, access to and use of the resource is often regulated by a set of rules or agreements that are developed and enforced by the community or group of stakeholders who share ownership.
        
Common property systems can be contrasted with private property systems, where ownership and control are vested in a single individual or entity. Common property can promote more equitable access and use of resources, as well as fostering a sense of shared responsibility and stewardship among community members. However, it can also be challenging to manage and enforce, and may be vulnerable to overuse or depletion in the absence of effective governance mechanisms.`

    {
        title: 'Feudalism',
        body: `Feudalism was a social and economic system that emerged in Europe during the Middle Ages (roughly 9th to 15th centuries). It was based on a hierarchical relationship between lords (nobles and landowners) and vassals (knights and lesser nobles), in which the lords provided land and protection to their vassals in exchange for military and other services.

Under feudalism, land was the primary form of wealth, and was divided into large estates or manors, each controlled by a lord. The lord had the right to use the land for his own purposes, and to extract rents and other payments from the peasants who lived and worked on the land.
        
The peasants, in turn, were tied to the land and obligated to work for the lord in exchange for protection and the right to live on the land. This system of labor and land tenure was known as serfdom, and it constituted a form of bondage or unfree labor, as the peasants were unable to leave the land without the lord's permission.
        
Feudalism was characterized by a decentralized political system, in which power was held by local lords rather than a central government. This system of governance was supported by a complex set of social and cultural norms, including the idea of chivalry (a code of behavior for knights), and the concept of nobility (the idea that some individuals were born into a superior social class).
        
Feudalism began to decline in Europe during the late Middle Ages, as the rise of commerce and trade, the growth of cities, and the emergence of centralized states led to changes in the social and economic order. By the end of the 15th century, feudalism had largely disappeared in Western Europe, though some aspects of the system persisted in other parts of the world for several centuries.`

    {
        title: 'Internationalism',
        body: `Internationalism is a political ideology or perspective that emphasizes international cooperation and solidarity among people and nations. It advocates for the creation of a global community based on shared values and interests, and the promotion of peace, social justice, and human rights across national borders.

Internationalism views the world as interconnected and interdependent, and rejects nationalism and isolationism, which prioritize the interests of one nation or group over others. It promotes the idea that all people have a right to self-determination, and that no nation or group should have the right to dominate or exploit others.
        
Internationalism is often associated with progressive or leftist movements, such as socialism, communism, and anti-colonialism, which emphasize the importance of global solidarity and cooperation among workers, peasants, and oppressed groups. It is also associated with movements for peace, environmental justice, and human rights, which seek to address global challenges that cannot be solved by any one nation or group alone.
        
Internationalism can take various forms, such as international alliances, treaties, and institutions, or grassroots movements and networks. It can also involve practices such as cultural exchange, mutual aid, and non-violent resistance.`

    {
        title: 'Liberal democracy',
        body: `Liberal democracy is a form of government that combines the principles of liberal political philosophy with democratic institutions and practices. In a liberal democracy, the government is based on the consent of the governed and operates under the rule of law, protecting individual liberties and human rights, and promoting social and economic freedom.

In a liberal democracy, the government is usually divided into separate branches, with each having its own powers and responsibilities, and a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. Elections are held regularly, and citizens have the right to participate in the political process through voting, free speech, and other forms of civic engagement.
        
The liberal democratic tradition emerged in Europe and North America during the 18th and 19th centuries, as a response to the absolutist monarchies and authoritarian regimes of the time. It has since become the dominant form of government in much of the world, particularly in Western countries and their spheres of influence.
        
Liberal democracy is often contrasted with other forms of democracy, such as direct democracy or participatory democracy, which emphasize more direct forms of citizen involvement in decision-making. It is also contrasted with authoritarian or illiberal forms of democracy, which place greater emphasis on order and stability at the expense of individual rights and freedoms.`

    {
        title: 'Planned economy',
        body: `In a planned economy, the government or central planning authority makes economic decisions, such as what goods and services to produce, how much to produce, and how to distribute them, based on specific objectives that are democratically chosen by the people. This means that the goals and priorities of the economy are determined through a democratic process that involves public input and participation.

Under a planned economy, the decisions made by the government or central planning authority, such as setting production targets and assigning resources to meet those targets, often through a series of five-year plans, determining wages and prices, and operating many or all of the country's major industries, are guided by the needs and preferences of the population as a whole, as determined through democratic processes such as elections, referendums, or public forums.
        
A planned economy can help ensure that the needs and interests of the entire population are taken into account, rather than just those of a small group of elites or special interests. It can also help to promote greater social and economic equality, as decisions are made with a view to meeting the needs of all members of society.`

    {
        title: 'Private property',
        body: `Private property refers to the legal and social concept of exclusive ownership and control over tangible and intangible assets, goods, and resources. In a capitalist system, private property is a central feature, as individuals and organizations are able to own and control property, and are free to use it for their own purposes and interests.

Private property can include physical assets such as land, buildings, and equipment, as well as intangible assets such as intellectual property, patents, and trademarks. Private property rights are generally enforced by the government through the legal system, which protects individuals and organizations from theft, trespass, and other forms of unauthorized use.
        
The concept of private property has been a topic of debate and controversy throughout history, particularly in regards to its impact on social and economic inequality. Some argue that private property is a fundamental human right, promoting individual liberty and economic growth, while others argue that it can lead to unequal distribution of resources and power, and that the concept of private property is itself a social construction that can be changed to promote greater equity and social justice.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Proletariat',
        body: `The proletariat is a term used to describe the working class, particularly those who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor in order to survive. The term was coined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-19th century, and it played a central role in their theory of class struggle and the development of socialism.

According to Marxist theory, the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie, who control the means of production and extract surplus value from the labor of the working class. The proletariat is thus seen as a revolutionary class, capable of overthrowing the capitalist system and establishing a socialist society in which the means of production are owned collectively by the workers.
        
The concept of the proletariat has been influential in the development of labor movements, socialist and communist politics, and the study of social class and inequality. While the nature and composition of the working class has changed over time, the idea of a fundamental conflict between labor and capital remains a central theme in Marxist thought and social analysis.`

    {
        title: 'Reformism',
        body: `Reformism is a political strategy within left-wing politics that aims to achieve social and economic change through gradual, incremental reforms rather than revolutionary or radical means. Reformists believe that progress can be made within the existing political and economic systems, and that change can be achieved through democratic means such as elections and lobbying.

Reformist policies typically focus on improving the lives of working-class people and marginalized communities through measures such as social welfare programs, labor protections, and progressive taxation. Reformists may also advocate for policies that promote environmental sustainability and combat climate change.
        
Reformism is often contrasted with revolutionary or radical politics, which seek to fundamentally transform the existing social and economic systems through more drastic means such as armed struggle or mass mobilization.`

        title: 'Scientific socialism',
        body: `Scientific socialism, also known as Marxism, is a political and economic theory developed by the German philosopher and economist Karl Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels. It is a comprehensive theory that seeks to understand and explain social, economic, and political structures, and to identify the historical processes that shape them.

At its core, scientific socialism is based on the idea that society is divided into classes, with the ruling class controlling the means of production and exploiting the working class. It argues that this inequality and exploitation are the fundamental causes of social and economic problems, and that they can only be addressed through a fundamental transformation of society, known as a socialist revolution.
        
Scientific socialism emphasizes the importance of scientific analysis and historical materialism, which is the idea that economic and social conditions are the primary factors that shape human history. It also emphasizes the importance of class struggle, which is the conflict between the ruling class and the working class, as the driving force behind historical change.
        
The goal of scientific socialism is to establish a classless society in which the means of production are owned and controlled collectively by the people, rather than by a small ruling class. It advocates for the abolition of private property and the establishment of a planned economy, in which production is organized according to the needs of society as a whole, rather than the profit motive of individual capitalists.`

    {
        title: 'Socialism',
        body: `Socialism is a political and economic theory that advocates for the collective ownership and control of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. In a socialist system, the means of production are owned and managed by the state, by workers cooperatives or by the community, rather than by private individuals or corporations.

Socialism emerged in the 19th century as a response to the inequalities and social problems created by capitalism. Socialists argue that capitalism creates a society in which wealth and power are concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority of people are left with little or no control over their lives and livelihoods.
        
Socialism seeks to create a more egalitarian and democratic society in which wealth and resources are distributed more equally and decision-making power is shared by all members of society. Socialists believe that this can be achieved through the establishment of a planned economy, where production and distribution are based on the needs of society rather than on the pursuit of profit.
        
There are many different varieties of socialism, ranging from democratic socialism, which seeks to reform capitalism through the establishment of a strong welfare state, to revolutionary socialism, which aims to overthrow capitalism and establish a socialist society through a revolutionary struggle.`

        title: 'Social democracy',
        body: `Social democracy is a political ideology and economic system that seeks to balance the benefits of market-based capitalism with social welfare policies that support the well-being of all members of society. Social democrats generally believe that government has a responsibility to provide a range of social services and protections, including healthcare, education, and social safety nets, in order to ensure that everyone has a fair and equal chance to succeed.

Social democracy emerged as a response to the perceived failures of unfettered capitalism and the excesses of socialism and communism in the early 20th century. It emphasizes the importance of democratic governance and civil liberties, while also recognizing the need for government intervention in the economy to address issues such as inequality, poverty, and unemployment.
        
In practice, social democratic policies may include universal healthcare systems, free or subsidized education, progressive taxation, minimum wage laws, and strong labor protections. Social democrats may also advocate for policies that promote environmental sustainability, such as investment in renewable energy and measures to combat climate change.`

        title: 'Social justice',
        body: `Social justice is a concept that refers to the idea of creating a fair and equal society, in which all individuals and groups have access to the same opportunities and resources, and are treated with dignity and respect. It emphasizes the need to address inequalities and discrimination based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and ability, and to ensure that all people have access to basic human rights and a decent standard of living.

Social justice is often associated with political movements and activism that seek to challenge and transform the social, economic, and political systems that perpetuate injustice and inequality. These movements may advocate for policies and practices that promote equality and opportunity, such as affirmative action, living wages, and universal healthcare. They may also focus on issues such as access to education, affordable housing, and criminal justice reform, which disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
        
Social justice is also grounded in a set of moral and ethical principles that emphasize the importance of human dignity, respect for diversity, and a commitment to the common good. It emphasizes the importance of empathy and solidarity, and the need to recognize and challenge systems of oppression and privilege that perpetuate inequality and injustice.`

        title: 'State',
        body: `a state can be defined as a defined geographical region that is governed by a centralized authority or government. This authority is responsible for providing public services, enforcing laws, and maintaining order within the state's boundaries.

States can vary widely in their form of government, ranging from democratic republics to monarchies, dictatorships, or other types of political systems. The government of a state typically has control over its territory, and may exercise authority over its citizens, businesses, and institutions.
        
In international relations, a state is recognized as a sovereign entity with a defined territory, a permanent population, and a government capable of controlling its territory and conducting foreign affairs. The recognition of a state's sovereignty by other states is a key element of international law and diplomacy.`

        title: 'Top-down structure',
        body: `A top-down organization or structure is one in which decision-making and control are centralized and concentrated in a few individuals or a single authority at the top of the hierarchy. In a top-down organization, power and influence flow from the top downward, with directives and policies being issued by those in positions of authority to those at lower levels.

In a top-down approach, decision-making and strategy-setting are often carried out by a small group of executives or leaders, who then communicate their plans to subordinates for implementation. This approach emphasizes efficiency and speed, as well as clear lines of authority and accountability.
        
Examples of top-down organizations include traditional corporations, where decisions are made by a board of directors and executed by managers and employees, and authoritarian governments, where power is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or ruling party.
        
A top-down approach can be effective in certain contexts, such as in emergency situations where quick decision-making and clear chains of command are crucial. However, it can also be prone to inefficiencies and inflexibility, as well as stifling innovation and creativity. Additionally, it can lead to feelings of disempowerment and lack of investment among employees or members, who may feel disconnected from the decision-making process.`
